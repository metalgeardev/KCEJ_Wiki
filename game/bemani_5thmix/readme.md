## Source Code
Near-final source code can be found on the beatmania BEST HITS (SLPM-86596) disc. The file __cdrom0:\DUMMY__ is an LZH archive that contains the directory __C:\5thMix\Work.5th__ from programmer Tan Yudon's hard disk. This file was made into garbage data for the "Konami The BEST" reissue (SLPM-86830). It can be compiled into a working executable with the Psy-Q PlayStation SDK.

It's worth noting that some of the libraries and modules were originally written by Production Department #1 for Metal Gear Solid.
